This repository is where I put my UPPAAL model of Non preemtive protocol (NPP)


## General Information

Some aspect related to the model

1. Notation
    - All notation are decribed in the the declaration file inside the UPPAL model
2. Interupt Mode
    - Interrupt is enabled bz default but can be change in declaration file inside the UPPAL model
3. NPP integration
    - The model is by default integrated with NPP but can be disable in declaration file inside the UPPAL model

## Simulation

- You can try to play with the simulation (by disabling or eanabling the interrrupt and NPP). 
- Compre the number of fail of each task and longest blocking time expereience by a task in all possible mode.
- Have fun with the simulation!!!


## Copy right
-This model is fully design by me and you are allowed to copy it and do what ever you want
